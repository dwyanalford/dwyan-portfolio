## Dwyan Alford's Portfolio Site

How I built my portfolio web app:<br>
* **Node/Express** server set up and routing, connection to **MongoDB** (Database) via **Mongoose** (for Database Modeling).<br>
* *Create*, *Read* and *Delete* operations completed and users can test this functionality like this: 
  1. Visit my portfolio web site at: www.dwyanalford.com
  2. Fill out the contact form on my contact page and send me a message
  3. Go to this Admin page to see the information you entered updated. 
  4. Free free to test out the email and delete buttons as well.<br>
* **React** and **React-Router** - Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and using **Axios** to communicate between client and server.<br>
* This is a **Responsive Design** application<br>
* Responsive Theme Color - Smaller Screens (white) / Larger Screens(dark)<br>
