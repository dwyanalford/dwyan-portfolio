## Dwyan Alford's Portfolio Site

How I built my portfolio web app:<br>
* Node/Express server set up and routing, connection to MongoDB (Database) via Mongoose (for Database Modeling). 
* Create, Read and Delete operations completed and users can test this functionality like this: 
  1. Visit my portfolio web site at: www.dwyanalford.com
  2. Fill out the contact form on my contact page and send me a message
  3. Go to this Admin page to see the information you entered updated. 
  4. Free free to test out the email and delete buttons as well.
* Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and using Axios to communicate between client and server.
* Responsive Design
* Responsive Theme Color - Smaller Screens (white) / Larger Screens(dark)
