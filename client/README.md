## Dwyan Alford's Portfolio Web App

How I built my portfolio web app:<br>
* **Node/Express** server set up and routing, connection to **MongoDB** (Database) via **Mongoose** (for Database Modeling).<br>
* *Create*, *Read* and *Delete* operations completed and users can test this functionality like this: 
  1. Visit my portfolio web site at: www.dwyanalford.com
  2. Fill out the contact form on my contact page and send me a message
  3. Go to this Admin page to see the information you entered updated. 
  4. To test the email and delete butoons on the admin page you can go ahead and delete the record you submitted<br>
* **React** and **React-Router** - Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and using **Axios** to communicate between client and server.<br>
* This is a **Responsive Design** application<br>
* Responsive Theme Color - Smaller Screens (white) / Larger Screens(dark)<br>
